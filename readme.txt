*********Coronavirus Covid-19 Vulnerability Tester ********

Tool to help the person to get the rough idea about how much vulnerable he is to the Coronavirus Covid-19.

In this program, i have used the pointing scale. This will calculate total points considering different symptoms. After calculating
symptoms, this program will give the rough idea about how much vulnerable the person is.

Thankyou!!!
